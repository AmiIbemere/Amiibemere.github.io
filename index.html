        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a Lead toddler teacher for Childtime Learning Center. I work with toddlers ages one to two. The center runs on a schedule that focuses on the cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical development of the children. I started in this profession when I was nineteen years old. I initially worked at another center which is La Petite Academy. I started as an assistant teacher until I then became fully qualified to be a lead teacher in which I then got my own class. 
To be fully qualified for the role of Lead teacher, I had to take a few college courses and have some certifications. I had to have my CPR certification. To be CPR certified, I had to take a course which taught me about choking, choking hazards, asthma attacks, preventing choking on adults and children, and airway blockages. The CPR course is a hands-on learning course, so once I went through a bit of lecturing, I practiced different techniques with adult and baby mannequins. The courses I took to have Lead Teacher qualifications were for Early Childhood Education courses. These courses taught about cognitive development in toddlers, infants, and children. They also taught about physical development which has to do with gross motor skills and fine motor skills. Socio-emotional development has to do with expressing emotions and processing emotions. These courses prepared me to work with children of all ages but mostly prepared me to work with children from birth to 2 years of age. 
When I left La Petite Academy, I did not go to another center for about a year and I focused on schooling. At the time, I was making the transition from community college to a four year college which is University of California, Riverside. I wanted to make sure that my transition to UCR would be smooth and then once I got settled I could start working again. I did my first year at UCR which was my third year in college without working. After the first year, Childtime Learning Center reached out to me for a position which was a higher position than I had at La Petite Academy and with a different age group. I accepted the position and started working at Childtime in the infant class. While this age group is not too far from the toddler age group, there are new techniques and ways of working that I did not use when working with the toddler class. 
In this new class, I have grown much patience and understanding for infants. I grow relationships with the children to understand them better and attend to their needs. I have grown to be more alert with infants because they are in a sense more fragile and tender than older children. They demand much attention and care.
